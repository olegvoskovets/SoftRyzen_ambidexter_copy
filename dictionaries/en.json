His lessons are incredibly well structured, Kirill gave me a lot of practical exercises that help in other domains as well (exercises for articulation and improving the voice, exercises to develop quick thinking and reaction, etc.) Thanks to Kirill, I now sail through my presentations pain-free, and even took up a new interest in public speaking.",

То ж ви не тільки пропрацюєте окремі елементи як то імпровізація, інтонація, жести тощо, але й повноцінний виступ.
